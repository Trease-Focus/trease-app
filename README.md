## About

**Trease** is an open-source focus tool.

When you want to focus, plant a seed. As time passes, the seed grows into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither.

> "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

## Features

Trease is built with simplicity, privacy, and performance in mind using Kotlin Multiplatform.

* **Unified Experience:** A single, native codebase providing fluid performance on Android, Linux, Windows, iOS.
* **App Blocker:**  Block distractions when focusing (only available on android rn )
* **Detailed Analytics:** Insightful charts to track your focus distribution over weeks and months.
* **Visual Forest:** Watch your forest grow as you accumulate productive hours.
* **Open Source:** No hidden tracking, no ads, and completely transparent code.
